# IIpho3nix's Capes Mod
 ## Description
 IIpho3nix's Capes Mod is a client-side Fabric mod designed for Minecraft version 1.20.4. This mod introduces the ability to use .png and .gif files as capes in the game.

 ## Usage
    Ensure Capes Folder Exists:
        Before proceeding, make sure the "Capes" folder is present in the ".minecraft" directory. If it doesn't exist, create it manually.

    Download Capes:
        Obtain the cape designs you want in either .png or .gif format.

    Place Capes in the Capes Folder:
        Move the downloaded cape files into the "Capes" folder in the ".minecraft" directory.

    Launch Minecraft:
        Start Minecraft with the Fabric profile.

    Access Main Menu:
        Once in the main menu, look for the "Change Cape" button.

    Cycle through Capes:
        Press the "Change Cape" button until you find the cape you want to use. The cape currently in use is displayed at the top left corner of the screen.

    Enjoy Your Custom Cape:
        Your selected cape will now be visible in-game, allowing you to showcase your unique style.

 ## Additional Notes

    This mod is client-side, meaning only you can see the custom cape. Other players on the server won't be able to see your cape.

    Ensure that the chosen cape files are in either .png or .gif format for compatibility with the mod.

    Be cautious when downloading cape files from external sources to avoid potential security risks.
